# Speech-Analysis
This project is about translating and summarization the speech to text using pretrained models from hugging face.

Speech recognition using SpeechRecognition library and Facebook Wav2Vec2 model for transcribing audio.
• Integrated language detection functionality using langdetect library to determine the language of transcribed text.
• Tested and debugged language detection algorithms to ensure accurate identification of languages in speech NLP.
• Tech stack used: Python, Wav2Vec2, Speech Processing.
